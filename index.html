                    <p>At PLDT, I noticed the strict security the moment we arrived, showing how important and sensitive their operations are. The staff welcomed us properly and gave us an overview of how their systems work, including their data centers and stations. They also explained how they designed their facility to stay safe from natural disasters like earthquakes and typhoons. Everything looked well-maintained and clearly managed by people who know what they are doing.</p>
                    <p><strong>Learnings</strong></p>
                    <p>I learned that providing communication services to millions of users requires technical skill and strong dedication. Their backup power systems and careful handling of equipment showed me how prepared they need to be in every situation. The visit helped me understand that this type of work demands commitment, preparation, and teamwork.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
                    <p>The experience gave me a clearer picture of what it takes to run a large communication company. It made me appreciate the effort behind maintaining stable and reliable connections for people every day.</p>

                    <p><strong>Observations</strong></p>
                    <p>JairosSoft had a friendlier and more relaxed environment, but it was still clear that everyone understood their responsibilities. The staff introduced themselves and explained their roles, and I saw how well they communicated and supported one another. Their teamwork was very noticeable, and the tour showed how connected each task is to the whole operation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Learnings</strong></p>
                    <p>From this visit, I learned that teamwork plays a huge role in the tech industry. With technology advancing so quickly, relying only on yourself would slow everything down. A cooperative team makes tasks easier, faster, and more efficient. It also made me realize that communication and good working relationships are just as important as technical knowledge.</p>

                    <p>The visit helped me understand how much easier and smoother work becomes when there is good teamwork. It made me value collaboration more, especially in fast-changing fields like technology.</p>
